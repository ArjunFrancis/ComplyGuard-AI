## 🏆 JUDGING CRITERIA

ComplyGuard-AI evaluated on four dimensions:

| Criterion | Weight | Our Strength | Score Confidence |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Impact** | 40% | Solves real enterprise pain (Air Canada lawsuit) | 🟢 High |
| **Technical Depth & Execution** | 30% | Full Gemini 3 Pro multimodal + working MVP | 🟢 High |
