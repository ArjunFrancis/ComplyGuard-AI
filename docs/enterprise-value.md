## 💰 ROI Calculator

### Scenario 1: Healthcare Provider (HIPAA Focus)

**Organization Profile:**
- Size: 5,000 employees
- AI Use Case: Patient chatbot answering insurance questions
- Risk: PHI exposure (medical diagnoses, treatment plans)

**Without ComplyGuard-AI:**
```
Risk Probability: 15% chance of HIPAA violation per year
Average Penalty: $250,000 (5 violations @ $50K each)
Legal Fees: $150,000
Remediation Costs: $100,000
Reputation Damage: $500,000 (patient churn)

Total Annual Risk: $1,000,000 × 15% = $150,000 expected loss
```

**With ComplyGuard-AI:**
```
Annual Cost: $15,000 (Professional tier)
Risk Reduction: 90% (violations detected pre-launch)
Residual Risk: $150,000 × 10% = $15,000

Net Savings: $150,000 - $15,000 - $15,000 = $120,000/year
ROI: ($120,000 / $15,000) = 800% or 8x return
```

**3-Year Value:**
- Cost: $45,000
- Savings: $360,000
- **Net Benefit: $315,000**

---

### Scenario 2: Financial Services (SOX + GDPR)

**Organization Profile:**
- Size: 10,000 employees
- AI Use Case: Fraud detection system flagging transactions

GDPR Violation Risk: 10% per year
Average GDPR Fine: €8,000,000 ($8.5M USD)
Legal/Audit Costs: $500,000

Total Annual Risk: 
  ($5M × 5%) + ($8.5M × 10%) + $500K = $1,600,000 expected loss
```

**With ComplyGuard-AI:**
```
Annual Cost: $30,000 (Enterprise tier)
Risk Reduction: 85%
Residual Risk: $1,600,000 × 15% = $240,000

Net Savings: $1,600,000 - $240,000 - $30,000 = $1,330,000/year
ROI: ($1,330,000 / $30,000) = 4,433% or 44x return
```

**3-Year Value:**
- Cost: $90,000
